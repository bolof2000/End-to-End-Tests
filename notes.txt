Interfaces that inherit the collection API

Maps: Interface
   Hashmap     Classes within these interface Map
   Hashtable
   TreeMap
   LinkedlistMap


Sets:
   HashSet
   LinkedHashSet
   TreeSet

Lists:
    ArrayList
    Vector
    LinkedlIst

Utilities:
    Collections
    Arrays

 Queues:
    PriorityQueue


Wrapper Classes:
Wrapper classes are those classes which are used to wrap primitive variables in such a way that they behave like an object
These are classes are:
Integer - for wrapping int value
Character for wrapping char value
Boolean for wrapping boolean value
Long for wrapping Long value
Float
Double

Autoboxing - Coverting the primitive to its wrapper class object
AutoUnboxing - coverting object to its primitive value

Reflections API:
Use to get information about your classes, variables, methods names, constructors name .
to determine which test cases has been executed , creating log file rather than using systems print out


MultiThreading and concurrent Programming - to solve parrell execution
ThreadLocal -

Parallel execution can be done with :
can be done with testng, xml file, selenium grid - selenium dristribute the code to differnt server

Ways to create Thread :
By extending Thread Class
By implementing the runnable interface

Steps:
Create a class extend Thread class
Override the run() method in the Thread class
Create an instance of your thread class
Then call the start()
Runnable interface is mostly used
